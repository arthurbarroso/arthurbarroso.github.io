<div>
    
    <p>I've been kinda fascinated about pre-rendering my react applications for about three months. It all started when I started to develop <a href="https://github.com/arthurbarroso/brundij">brundij</a> and realized I wouldn't be able to get good performance results without some prerendering techniques, which ultimately led me into reading lots of stuff about it.</p><p>I have developed React applications for some time already, but never really had to get prerendering to work without using frameworks such as Gatsby or Next, so this was a new challenge for me. I ended up deciding to write this post talking about all the stuff I tried and what I think about each of those. This should not be seen as a tutorial, all the stuff here is highly experimental.</p><p>While writing, I realized this post would end up getting quite lengthy, so I also pushed a demo repository with all the code you'd need to follow everything I've written. You can check it <a href="https://github.com/arthurbarroso/blog-prerendering-demo">here</a></p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents:</h2><ol><li><a href="#react">React prerendering</a></li><li><a href="#clojurescript">Clojurescript and prerendering</a></li><li><a href="#first">First setup: using GraalVM and Polyglot</a><ol><li><a href="#server">Server-side rendering</a></li><li><a href="#static">Generating static HTMLs</a></li><li><a href="#http">HTTP requests from within the client</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#etaoin">Second setup: Headless Chrome using Etaoin</a></li><li><a href="#script">Third setup: building prerender scripts using shadow-cljs</a></li><li><a href="#nbb">Fourth setup: using <code>nbb</code></a></li><li><a href="#wrapping">Wrapping up</a></li></ol><h3 id="react-prerendering">React prerendering <a name="react"></a><a></a></h3><p>Prerendering in React is commonly achieved by using frameworks such as Next.js and Gatsby. These tools/frameworks share a common feature: they make it possible to generate your application's static HTML on build time. (Next.js also makes it possible to generate the static content/page on each request, using server-side-rendering).</p><p>What happens for both of these strategies (static generation and server-side rendering) is that the React components/views get rendered to a string that later gets event handlers attached to it. This means the client downloads a prerendered static HTML version of the React application and React attaches event handlers to it afterward. This is done  by using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html">ReactDomServer.renderToString()</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">React.hydrate()</a>.</p><h3 id="clojurescript-and-prerendering">Clojurescript and prerendering <a name="clojurescript"></a></h3><p>I wanted to be able to write my applications using Clojurescript and still prerender them. The problem for Clojurescript is that these React prerendering frameworks often don't play well with it, as pointed out by Thomas Heller in <a href="https://clojureverse.org/t/creating-websites-with-shadow-cljs-gatsby-or-next-js/2912">this post</a>.</p><p>This ultimately got me into thinking about how could I achieve prerendering in my Reagent/re-frame applications without having to spin up a node server. I then started looking for stuff on that topic, which led me to a few findings:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nextjournal.com/kommen/react-server-side-rendering-with-graalvm-for-clojure">React Server Side Rendering with GraalVM for Clojure</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@joelsanchezclj/prerendering-a-re-frame-app-with-chrome-headless-bb875de31fd0">Prerendering a re-frame app with Chrome headless</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pupeno/prerenderer">pupeno/Prerenderer</a> - which I haven't yet tried and won't talk about in this post</li><li><a href="https://github.com/borkdude/nbb">borkdude/nbb</a></li></ul><p>These resources helped me grasp things and try a few different setups, which I'll describe here.</p><h3 id="first-setup-using-graalvm-and-polyglot">First setup: using GraalVM and Polyglot <a name="first"></a></h3><p>This setup is heavily based on the post I linked above, <a href="https://nextjournal.com/kommen/react-server-side-rendering-with-graalvm-for-clojure">React Server Side Rendering with GraalVM for Clojure</a>, but I decided to tweak things a little bit to better suit my development workflow:</p><ul><li>Instead of using Nextjournal's custom Clojurescript version, I decided to go with <code>shadow-cljs</code> and use its related Clojurescript version.</li><li>I wanted to use re-frame to control my application's state.</li></ul><p>To acheive this, I needed to do some digging and do some hackish things that aren't really recommended. Let's take a look at the steps needed to get shadow, graal and re-frame working:</p><p>We will start by first defining our <code>deps.edn</code> file:</p><pre><code class="clj">;;deps.edn
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        reagent/reagent {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}
        thheller/shadow-cljs {:mvn/version "2.15.10"}
        re-frame/re-frame {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}
        org.clojure/core.async {:mvn/version "1.3.618"}}

 :paths ["src" "dev"]

 :aliases {:cljs {:main-opts ["-m" "shadow.cljs.devtools.cli"]
                  :paths ["src" "dev"]}

           :repl {:extra-deps {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "0.8.3"}
                               cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.26.0"}}
                  :extra-paths ["public/assets"]
                  :main-opts ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline"
                              "--interactive"
                              "--middleware"
                              "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"]}}}
</code></pre><p>Now it is time to create our <code>shadow-cljs.edn</code> config file.</p><pre><code class="clj">;;shadow-cljs.edn
{:nrepl {:port 8777}

 :deps true

 :dev-http
 {8280 "public"}

 :builds
   {:app {:target :graaljs
          :output-to "public/assets/graal.js"
          :entries [app.component]
          :jvm-opts ["-Xmx4G"]
          :modules
          {:app {:init-fn [app.component/countinghtml]}}}}}
</code></pre><p>If we compile our code using the above configuration and try to use any of javascript's async functions such as <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> we'll be greeted with an error message saying async is not yet supported in shadow's graaljs target.  As seen on <a href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/685">this issue</a> on shadow-cljs's repo, Clojurescript removed the shims needed for async to work in its graaljs compile target, which means we'll have to add those shims ourselves.  We will want shadow to prepend our built code with these shims and also remove the definitions of the functions shadow creates for these. This can be done by adding the key <code>:prepend-js</code> pointing at <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/e4300da64c4781735146cafc0ca029046b83944c/src/main/cljs/cljs/bootstrap_graaljs.js">this file</a> to our <code>:app</code> module and by creating a build hook:</p><pre><code class="clj">;;shadow-cljs.edn
{...
 :builds
   {:app {...
          :modules
            {:app {:init-fn [app.component/countinghtml]}
           :prepend-js "./graal-bootstrap.js"}
          :build-hooks [(util.clean/hook)]}}}
</code></pre><p>Our hook:</p><pre><code class="clj">;;src/util/clean.clj
(ns util.clean
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.string :as string]))

(defn hook
  {:shadow.build/stage :flush}
  [build-state &amp; args]
  (let [original (slurp (io/file "public/assets/graal.js"))

</code></pre><p>The above build hook creates a copy of our shadow-built code and removes all of shadow's <code>graaljs async_not supported</code> functions, so our code ends up calling our shims instead of throwing async not supported errors.

This setup has been by far one of the easiest to get up and running.  You can either set it up as he did in his post (which serves as a server-side rendered version of your application) or use it to generate static HTML's like I did in <a href="https://github.com/arthurbarroso/brundij/blob/main/src/clj/brundij/pre_render.clj">this file</a>.</p><p>It is important to add that my setup for generating these static htmls helps me achieve good performance results, but isn't the best and does something wrong: it calls <code>react-dom.render</code> instead of <code>react-dom.hydrate</code>. This happens because I am using a library that injects css at the dom asynchronously, which means the server-rendered html would never match the client's html.</p><h3 id="third-setup-building-prerender-scripts-using-shadow-cljs">Third setup: building prerender scripts using shadow-cljs <a name="script"></a></h3><p>Another possible approach is to create a shadow project that runs two separate builds: one for the regular browser build and another one that creates a node script for generating the prerendered html.</p><p>I'll use the same codebase we've used for the previous setups for simplicity's sake. To set up this method, I'll add two new build's to our <code>shadow-cljs.edn</code> and a new file to our source code:</p><pre><code class="clj">{:nrepl {:port 8777}

This is needed because <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/nbb/issues/79"><code>nbb</code> doesn't support re-frame as of now</a>, so we simply "mock" those to pre-render and this is also the reason we need initial data. Our initial data must match the data that will be inserted at our re-frame's <code>db</code> so React's prerendered DOM matches the DOM React's hydrate expects. We also re-define <code>cljs-http</code> and <code>re-frame-cljs-http.http-fx</code> namespaces to avoid having to use replace-deps</p><p><code>nbb</code> supports adding clojure dependencies, but re-frame depends on a few <code>goog</code> classes that aren't defined on nbb right now.</p><p>Since our component/view is outside of our script, we'll need to pass our classpath to <code>nbb</code> and run it:</p><pre><code class="bash">classpath="$(clojure -A:nbb -Spath -Sdeps '{}')"
nbb --classpath "$classpath" script.cljs
</code></pre><p>You should now be able to run <code>clj -M:cljs watch browser</code> and visit <code>http://localhost:8280/counting-view.html</code> to check the nbb-preredered page.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up <a name="wrapping"></a></h3><p>It was pretty fun to try all of this stuff.
