It all started when I started to develop brundij and realized I wouldn't be able to get good performance results without some prerendering techniques, which ultimately led me into reading lots of stuff about it.I have developed React applications for some time already, but never really had to get prerendering to work without using frameworks such as Gatsby or Next, so this was a new challenge for me. I ended up deciding to write this post talking about all the stuff I tried and what I think about each of those. This should not be seen as a tutorial, all the stuff here is highly experimental.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://arthurbrrs.me/testing-the-dom-using-shadow-and-reagent.html</guid><link>https://arthurbrrs.me/testing-the-dom-using-shadow-and-reagent.html</link><title>Testing the DOM using shadow-cljs and Reagent</title><description>I've been recently trying to build brundij, an open-source tool for squad health checks. I ended up deciding on using Clojure and Clojurescript to build it (I've been learning clojure for a few months already but feel like a complete beginner, so I thought building something might help me grasp some stuff). I also decided to use shadow-cljs to set up my project.Everything was going pretty smoothly until I needed to run DOM tests, which seemed like a big mistery to me -it seemed like most CLJS developers were only using Cypress and the only post I could find talking about react-testing-library in clojurescript was two years old. All of this led me into creating this post, in which, I am going to try to help Clojurescript beginners, like me, run DOM tests on their shadow-cljs + reagent applications.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
