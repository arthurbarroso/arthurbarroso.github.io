I ended up deciding on using Clojure and Clojurescript to build it (I've been learning clojure for a few months already but feel like a complete beginner, so I thought building something might help me grasp some stuff). I also decided to use shadow-cljs to set up my project.Everything was going pretty smoothly until I needed to run DOM tests, which seemed like a big mistery to me -it seemed like most CLJS developers were only using Cypress and the only post I could find talking about react-testing-library in clojurescript was two years old. All of this led me into creating this post, in which, I am going to try to help Clojurescript beginners, like me, run DOM tests on their shadow-cljs + reagent applications.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
