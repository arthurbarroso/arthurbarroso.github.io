This can be done in several ways, such as storing files directly to your server's storage, saving these files inside a database, or uploading them to some cloud provider's service, such as AWS's S3. There are various reasons one may choose each of these strategies, but I decided to stick with the latter.</p><p>From my previous JavaScript/React experience I knew this could be done using S3's <code>pre-signed URLs</code>, but didn't know how to do this in Clojure, even though the overall process/technique isn't much different.</p><h3>How a pre-signed upload works using S3:</h3><ul><li>your client-side application sends your server some metadata about the file.</li><li>the server validates the metadata (this is kind of optional though).</li><li>the server then responds with a unique URL that can be used to perform a request to S3 to upload this file.</li><li>the client uploads the image/file to S3 and sends the server the URL so it can be stored in some kind of database.</li></ul><p><a class="continue-reading" href="pre-signed-s3-clojurescript.html">Continue reading &#8594;</a></div><div id="post"><div class="post-header"><a class="post-header-link" href="my-clojure-script-journey.html">My Clojure(script) journey</a><div id="post-meta"><div class="date">2021-11-30</div></div></div><p>I've been learning Functional Programming for quite some time: I studied a bit of Haskell, played around with ReasonML, and ultimately started to work with Elixir. At some point, though, I realized I wanted to try a different language: this is when Clojure comes in - it simply looked really different from the code I was used to writing, which made me decide on trying to learn it.</p><p>Clojure is a really nice language and the whole "REPL oriented development" thing is magic, but it took me some time to actually enjoy the language and learn what the REPL meant for the whole development experience. I'll use this post to talk a little about my Clojure(script) journey and how I eventually started loving it.</p><p><a class="continue-reading" href="my-clojure-script-journey.html">Continue reading &#8594;</a></div><div id="post"><div class="post-header"><a class="post-header-link" href="dealing-with-corrupt-messages-using-broadway-and-sqs.html">Handling message errors using Broadway and AWS SQS</a><div id="post-meta"><div class="date">2021-11-22</div></div></div><p>For the past few months, I've been working on an Elixir project for a fintech. This project had one particularity: its main source of data would come from SQS queues -almost no data would be created from the application itself. Since SQS needed to be used, Broadway seemed like the right tool for the job.</p><p>In this post, I am going to talk a little about how I managed to set up a data ingestion pipeline using Broadway to consume data from an SQS queue while dealing with corrupt messages and other constraints. I'll use simpler schemas and data to represent stuff, but it should help you in complex cases, such as the one I went through.</p><p><a class="continue-reading" href="dealing-with-corrupt-messages-using-broadway-and-sqs.html">Continue reading &#8594;</a></div></div></div></div><footer>Copyright &copy; 2021 Arthur Barroso</footer></div></body><script src="/js/clojure_highlighter.js"></script><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
