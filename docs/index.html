    <p>I've recently landed my first Clojure position and received an m1-powered MacBook. Two months before that, I had also bought myself an m1 MacBook air and had to set up Clojure to use it in my projects. Since I had no experience using macOS whatsoever I had to do some googling and managed to get a pretty simple setup running.</p><p>There are lots of tutorials out there on how to set up m1 laptops for Clojure usage, but there are a few quirks that aren't yet documented, such as how to get <code>clj-kondo</code> and <code>parinfer</code> to work in it. I'll try to cover these steps in this post, while also showing how to set up doom emacs and some other stuff I ended up using myself.</p>

    <p>I've recently stumbled upon a task: uploading images from an input and saving those. This can be done in several ways, such as storing files directly to your server's storage, saving these files inside a database, or uploading them to some cloud provider's service, such as AWS's S3. There are various reasons one may choose each of these strategies, but I decided to stick with the latter.</p><p>From my previous JavaScript/React experience I knew this could be done using S3's <code>pre-signed URLs</code>, but didn't know how to do this in Clojure, even though the overall process/technique isn't much different.</p>

    <p>I've been kinda fascinated about pre-rendering my react applications for about three months. It all started when I started to develop <a href="https://github.com/arthurbarroso/brundij">brundij</a> and realized I wouldn't be able to get good performance results without some prerendering techniques, which ultimately led me into reading lots of stuff about it.</p><p>I have developed React applications for some time already, but never really had to get prerendering to work without using frameworks such as Gatsby or Next, so this was a new challenge for me. I ended up deciding to write this post talking about all the stuff I tried and what I think about each of those. This should not be seen as a tutorial, all the stuff here is highly experimental.</p>

    <p>I've been recently trying to build a side-project. I ended up deciding on using Clojure and Clojurescript to build it (I've been learning clojure for a few months already but feel like a complete beginner, so I thought building something might help me grasp some stuff). I also decided to use <code>shadow-cljs</code> to set up my project.</p><p>Everything was going pretty smoothly until I needed to run DOM tests, which seemed like a big mistery to me -it seemed like most CLJS developers were only using Cypress and the <a href="https://francisvitullo.medium.com/a-way-of-testing-views-in-clojurescript-apps-98aaf57c5c2a">only post I could find talking about <code>react-testing-library</code> in clojurescript</a> was two years old. All of this led me into creating this post, in which, I am going to try to help Clojurescript beginners, like me, run DOM tests on their shadow-cljs + reagent applications.</p>
