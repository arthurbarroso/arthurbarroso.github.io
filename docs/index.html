    <p>For the past few months, I've been working on an Elixir project for a fintech. This project had one particularity: its main source of data would come from SQS queues -almost no data would be created from the application itself. Since SQS needed to be used, Broadway seemed like the right tool for the job.</p><p>In this post, I am going to talk a little about how I managed to set up a data ingestion pipeline using Broadway to consume data from an SQS queue while dealing with corrupt messages and other constraints. I'll use simpler schemas and data to represent stuff, but it should help you in complex cases, such as the one I went through.</p><h3>Base concerns</h3><p>

    <p>I've been kinda fascinated about pre-rendering my react applications for about three months. It all started when I started to develop <a href='https://github.com/arthurbarroso/brundij'>brundij</a> and realized I wouldn't be able to get good performance results without some prerendering techniques, which ultimately led me into reading lots of stuff about it.</p><p>I have developed React applications for some time already, but never really had to get prerendering to work without using frameworks such as Gatsby or Next, so this was a new challenge for me. I ended up deciding to write this post talking about all the stuff I tried and what I think about each of those. This should not be seen as a tutorial, all the stuff here is highly experimental.</p><p>

    <p>I've been recently trying to build <a href='https://github.com/arthurbarroso/brundij'>brundij</a>, an open-source tool for squad health checks. I ended up deciding on using Clojure and Clojurescript to build it (I've been learning clojure for a few months already but feel like a complete beginner, so I thought building something might help me grasp some stuff). I also decided to use <code>shadow-cljs</code> to set up my project.</p><p>Everything was going pretty smoothly until I needed to run DOM tests, which seemed like a big mistery to me -it seemed like most CLJS developers were only using Cypress and the <a href='https://francisvitullo.medium.com/a-way-of-testing-views-in-clojurescript-apps-98aaf57c5c2a'>only post I could find talking about <code>react-testing-library</code> in clojurescript</a> was two years old. All of this led me into creating this post, in which, I am going to try to help Clojurescript beginners, like me, run DOM tests on their shadow-cljs + reagent applications.</p><p>
