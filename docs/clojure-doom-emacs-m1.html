    <p>I've recently landed my first Clojure position and received an m1-powered MacBook. Two months before that, I had also bought myself an m1 MacBook air and had to set up Clojure to use it in my projects. Since I had no experience using macOS whatsoever I had to do some googling and managed to get a pretty simple setup running.</p><p>There are lots of tutorials out there on how to set up m1 laptops for Clojure usage, but there are a few quirks that aren't yet documented, such as how to get <code>clj-kondo</code> and <code>parinfer</code> to work in it. I'll try to cover these steps in this post, while also showing how to set up doom emacs and some other stuff I ended up using myself.</p><p>Let's get to it:</p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents:</h2><ol><li><a href="#java">Installing Java and Clojure</a></li><li><a href="#emacs">Doom Emacs</a></li><li><a href="#kondo">Clj-kondo</a></li><li><a href="#parinfer">Parinfer-rust</a></li></ol><h3 id="installing-java-and-clojure">Installing Java and Clojure <a name="java"></a></h3><p>This post will describe two ways of installing Java and Clojure: one will use <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a> and the other will install things manually.</p><h4 id="using-homebrew">Using homebrew:</h4><p>We'll go the easy route here: we will use Homebrew to install Zulu (an m1 native version of the JVM), Clojure, Java, and Leiningen. To do so, we'll start by adding homebrew:</p><pre><code class="bash">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
</code></pre><p>After installing, homebrew will ask us to add it to our PATH. We'll do so and move on to installing Java, Clojure, and Leiningen:</p><pre><code class="bash">arch -arm64 brew install zulu clojure/tools/clojure leiningen
</code></pre><p>With the above done, we'll now simply add our <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to our PATH:</p><pre><code class="bash">export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home"
</code></pre><p>To verify our setup, we can simply run <code>clojure</code> and open up a REPL.</p><h4 id="manual-installation">Manual installation:</h4><p>We will start by downloading Azul's Zulu m1 build from their <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&amp;os=macos&amp;architecture=arm-64-bit&amp;package=jdk">downloads page</a>. With the download done, we'll open the <code>zip</code> file and copy the <code>zulu-17.jdk</code> folder to <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/</code>. We'll also set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> variable:</p><pre><code class="bash">export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home"
</code></pre><p>With <code>JAVA_HOME</code> set up, it is time to install Leiningen, which will also install Clojure. To do so, we'll simply follow <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen's instructions</a>.</p><p>With the above done, we can now verify our setup by running <code>clojure</code>.</p><h3 id="doom-emacs">Doom Emacs <a name="emacs"></a></h3><p>My editor of choice is Doom Emacs. To use it, we'll need to first download emacs. This will be done using homebrew:</p><pre><code class="bash">brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install --cask emacs-mac
</code></pre><p>With the step above done, we'll now move into getting <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">Doom Emacs</a>:</p><pre><code class="bash">git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
</code></pre><p>Lets now configure it so we can use tools such as CIDER and clojure-lsp. This can be done by changing the <code>.doom.d/init.el</code> file. We'll start by uncommenting <code>lsp</code>, and <code>clojure</code> (under <code>:lang</code>). We will also want to add <code>+lsp</code> to that <code>clojure</code> expression, making it <code>(clojure +lsp)</code>. Having done that, we'll run <code>~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync</code> and our pretty basic Clojure environment will be set up.</p><h3 id="clj-kondo">Clj-kondo <a name="kondo"></a></h3><p>Adding <code>+lsp</code> to <code>clojure</code> in <code>init.el</code> made doom add <code>clojure-lsp</code> to our emacs configuration. Clojure-LSP comes with <code>clj-kondo</code>, but, for some reason I do not know, <code>flycheck</code> won't recognize it, so we'll probably also want to install kondo as a separate executable. To do so, we'll need to install GraalVM.</p><p>Setting up GraalVM on an m1 device currently requires using a snapshot, so we'll simply use it. Follow <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666#issuecomment-1074884020">this comment</a> to get it up and running. (The file you should download is <code>graalvm-ce-java17-darwin-aarch64-dev.tar.gz</code>). After setting up, also add the <code>GRAALVM_HOME</code> variable to <code>PATH</code> -it should match the value for the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> for Graal.</p><p>We can now compile and install clj-kondo on an m1 device:</p><pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo.git
cd clj-kondo
script/compile
</code></pre><p>Now simply add it to your PATH and you'll be able to use <code>clj-kondo</code> in <code>flycheck</code>.</p><h3 id="parinfer-rust">Parinfer-rust <a name="parinfer"></a></h3><p>There is currently no releases of <code>parinfer-rust</code> for m1 devices. This means we need to compile it ourselves. We'll need to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">install rust</a>:</p><pre><code class="bash">curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
</code></pre><p>We'll then move into compiling parinfer-rust:</p><pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/eraserhd/parinfer-rust.git
cd parinfer-rust
cargo build --release --features emacs
</code></pre><p>After compiling it, we'll move it to emacs:</p><pre><code class="bash">mkdir ~/.emacs.d/.local/etc/parinfer-rust
mv target/release/libparinfer_rust.dylib ~/.emacs.d/.local/etc/parinfer-rust/parinfer-rust-darwin.so
</code></pre><p>We'll activate parinfer on our doom config by uncommenting <code>parinfer</code> in <code>~/.doom.d/init.el</code> and adding <code>(use-package! parinfer-rust-mode)</code> to our <code>~/.doom.d/packages.el</code> file and run <code>~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync</code></p><p>And that's pretty much it for a basic setup :) Hope someone finds this useful</p>
